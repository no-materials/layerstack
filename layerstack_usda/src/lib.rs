//! USDA (text format) parser for layerstack.
//!
//! This crate provides a production-quality parser for the USDA scene
//! description format as specified in AOUSD Core §16.2. It is designed
//! around three layers:
//!
//! 1. **Lexer** ([`lexer`]) — Tokenizes USDA source into a stream of
//!    [`Token`](lexer::Token)s with span information. Whitespace, comments,
//!    and all syntactic punctuation are preserved as tokens to support
//!    lossless round-tripping.
//!
//! 2. **CST** (concrete syntax tree) — A lossless, whitespace-preserving
//!    tree representation of the source. Every byte of the original input
//!    can be recovered from the CST. This enables formatters, refactoring
//!    tools, and syntax highlighting.
//!
//! 3. **AST** (abstract syntax tree) — A typed, validated tree stripped of
//!    syntactic noise. Represents what was *authored* in the file, not what
//!    composition produces.
//!
//! 4. **Bridge** — Lowers the AST into layerstack's [`Layer`] / [`PrimSpec`]
//!    document model for composition.
//!
//! The parser supports error recovery: malformed input produces partial
//! trees with diagnostics rather than hard failures.
//!
//! # `no_std` support
//!
//! This crate is `no_std` by default, operating on byte slices (`&[u8]`)
//! and `&str` buffers. Enable the `std` feature for file I/O convenience
//! methods and `std::error::Error` integration.
//!
//! [`Layer`]: layerstack::Layer
//! [`PrimSpec`]: layerstack::PrimSpec
