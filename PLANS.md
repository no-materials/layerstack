# Sparse Array Edits Execution Plan

## Goals

- Add a core sparse array edit value family to `layerstack`.
- Preserve enough property declaration metadata to resolve typed array edits.
- Refactor value resolution so sparse array opinions compose over weaker opinions, including time samples.
- Extend `layerstack_usda` to parse and emit authored `edit(...)` values.
- Extend `layerstack_usdc` behind an explicit cargo feature for experimental sparse array edit decoding/assembly.
- Keep the work as a sequence of clean, coherent commits.

## Non-goals

- Generalize the new resolver to every possible future sparse value family in the first slice.
- Add new production dependencies.
- Implement stable public serialization for experimental USDC sparse array edits without a feature gate.

## Migration Note

- Public API changes are expected in `layerstack`:
  - `Value` will gain a sparse array edit variant.
  - Property declaration metadata will be preserved in the core document model.
  - Stage resolution semantics for array-valued fields will broaden from strongest-wins to composed sparse resolution.

## Phases

1. Data model foundation
   - Add property declaration metadata to the core document model and composition index.
   - Add sparse array edit kernel types and instruction semantics.
2. Resolution
   - Move composed-array resolution into a dedicated resolver module.
   - Integrate fallback seeding and time-sampled sparse composition.
3. USDA
   - Parse `edit(...)` as an authored value and emit it into the core model.
4. USDC
   - Add experimental sparse array edit decoding/assembly behind a cargo feature.
5. Validation
   - Add focused unit/integration tests and run fmt/clippy/test slices.

## Risks

- Property type information is currently discarded; sparse array edits require it for `minsize` / `resize`.
- Schema fallback is currently bolted on after authored resolution; sparse composition needs fallback as part of the weakest opinion chain.
- USDC support is inherently provisional until the proposal settles on stable wire encoding details.

## Follow-On: Generic Sparse Composition Kernel

### Endpoint

- `Stage` no longer knows about arrays as a special sparse-resolution case.
- Sparse-family detection and strong-over-weak folding live in an internal
  resolver module.
- Default-valued and time-sampled sparse resolution flow through the same
  internal family pipeline.
- Arrays remain the only shipped sparse family in this branch, but the internal
  seam is ready for another family without reopening `Stage`.

### Phases

1. Extract
   - Move sparse array resolution out of `stage.rs` into
     `layerstack/src/value_resolution.rs`.
2. Centralize
   - Make `Stage` call the resolver module rather than array-specific helpers.
3. Generalize internally
   - Introduce an internal sparse-family discriminator and family-owned
     composition API.
4. Unify sampled/default folding
   - Route default and time-sampled sparse resolution through a shared internal
     fold model.
5. Add invariant tests
   - Assert dense termination, sparse-over-sparse associativity, fallback
     seeding, and blocking behavior.
6. Stop there
   - Do not force a second sparse family into this branch unless one is
     genuinely ready.

## Spec Identity + defaultPrim Execution Plan

### Fence

`Path` owns concrete prim namespace paths. It explicitly does not own
variant-qualified opinion provenance or implicit arc targets; those belong to a
separate spec-identity layer and to reference/payload target resolution.

### Goals

- Add a first-class `SpecPath` identity model for composed opinion sources.
- Separate provenance identity from the concrete prim path used to look up
  authored `PrimSpec` data.
- Preserve variant-qualified source identities through `Stage` inspection APIs
  and conformance tests.
- Model references/payloads with an explicit authored target kind so omitted
  prim targets remain distinguishable from explicit `</Foo>` or `/`.
- Add `defaultPrim` layer metadata to USDA/USDC ingestion and compose omitted
  reference/payload targets through it.

### Non-goals

- Generalize `Path` into a universal spec/property/variant path syntax type.
- Implement relocates or value clips in this branch.
- Add a plugin-style provenance system.

### Migration Note

- Public API changes are expected in `layerstack`:
  - `OpinionKey::spec_path` and `Stage::prim_stack()` will expose `SpecPathId`
    instead of `PathId`.
  - `Stage` will expose composed `SpecPath` inspection helpers.
  - `Reference`/payload arc targets will move from always-concrete `PathId` to
    an explicit authored target enum that can represent implicit `defaultPrim`.
  - `Layer` will preserve `default_prim` metadata.

### Phases

1. Spec identity foundation
   - Add `spec_path.rs` with `SpecPath`, `SpecPathId`, and `SpecPathInterner`.
   - Thread a concrete lookup prim path separately from spec provenance through
     `OpinionKey`.
2. Composition integration
   - Intern spec identities while composing local, variant, inherit, reference,
     payload, and specializes opinions.
   - Update `Stage` inspection APIs and conformance harnesses to use the new
     spec identities directly.
3. Arc target modeling
   - Add an explicit reference target enum for authored prim-path vs implicit
     `defaultPrim`.
   - Preserve `defaultPrim` metadata on layers.
4. USDA + USDC
   - Parse/emit layer `defaultPrim` metadata in USDA.
   - Decode USDC pseudo-root `defaultPrim` and omitted arc targets into the new
     model.
5. Validation
   - Unignore the variant-qualified source identity conformance cases.
   - Add focused `defaultPrim` tests and reduce ignored composition cases to
     narrower remaining gaps.

### Risks

- Variant provenance is currently intertwined with actual prim lookup paths in
  `OpinionKey`; this refactor touches most composition entry points.
- `defaultPrim` behavior must preserve the authored distinction between an
  omitted target and an explicit prim path.
- USDC pseudo-root metadata is currently only partially assembled, so
  `defaultPrim` support has to fit that code path cleanly.
